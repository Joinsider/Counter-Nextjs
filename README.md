# Counter - NEXT.JS

A simple counter website written in Next.js. It is made for students of the DHBW Stuttgart Campus Horb and allows the users to track certain events. 
It is hosted on Vercel so it doesn't cost me anything. But as I am no longer actively using it no further development will flow into this project.

If you want to add any new features or fix bugs feel free to contact me or create a PR.
